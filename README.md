**Summary**

This study encompasses an actual hand tracking and analysis system implemented using Python and the OpenCV libraries. For hand tracking, the cv2 and
cvzone.HandTrackingModule libraries have been utilized. The system capable of detecting
hands in a camera feed can track multiple hands simultaneously on the screen.
The study facilitates hand detection from a camera feed within a loop, enabling the
determination of various features for each hand. Among the features are the identification
of specific points on the hand, drawing a bounding box around the hand, calculating the
center of the hand, and determining whether it is the left or right hand.
Moreover, there exists a finger counting function for determining the finger status of each
hand. When multiple hands are detected, it's possible to measure the distance between
each hand or ascertain the distance between specific points.
The primary goal of this study is to provide real-time hand detection and analysis, enabling
tracking of multiple hand movements and performing various calculations on the acquired
data. This system could be particularly useful in interactive applications or similar
hand-based control systems.
As a result, this study presents specific techniques used in hand tracking and their real-time
application. By manipulating the acquired data, it establishes a foundation to explore
potential uses and possible enhancements in such a system.
